Plus, only ~2,000/180,000 samples have a \"line_number\" value of over 15. So we would not be gaining much information about our data for doubling our feature space. This kind of problem is called the curse of dimensionality. However, since this we're working with deep models, it might be worth trying to throw as much information at the model as possible and seeing what happens. I'll leave exploring values of the depth parameter as an extension."
